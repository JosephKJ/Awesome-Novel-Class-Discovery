# Awesome-Novel-Class-Discovery 

Novel Class Discovery (NCD) is a machine learning problem, where novel categories of instances are to be automatically discovered from an unlabelled pool. In contrast to clustering, NCD setting has access to labelled data from a disjoint set of classes. This topic has plausible real-world applications and is gathering much attention in the research community.

Here, we provide a non-exhaustive list of papers that studies NCD.

# Definition of the settings

Some papers solve variations of the Novel Class Discovery, and are tagged accordingly. We provide a short description of these settings below:

**[NCD]**:  
_Novel Class Discovery_.  
We are given two sets of data: a labeled set $D^l = \\{ X^l, Y^l \\}$ of known classes $C^l$ and an unlabeled set $D^u = \\{ X^u \\}$ of unknown classes $C^u$ that must be discovered. In this case, $C^l \cap C^u = \emptyset$.

**[GNCD]**:  
_Generalized Novel Class Discovery_, also called _Open Set Domain Adaptation_ **[OSDA]**.  
We are also given $D^l =\\{ X^l, Y^l \\}$ and $D^u = \\{ X^u \\}$. But in this case, the $C^u$ classes of $D^u$ can contain both known and unknown classes (i.e. $C^l \subset C^u$ ). In other words, the condition from NCD that states that we can distinguish the instances of the known classes from the instances of the unknown classes is relaxed.

**[NCDSS]**:  
_Novel Class Discovery in Semantic Segmentation_.  
ToDo definition and mathematical formulation.

**[NCDwF]**:  
_Novel Class Discovery without Forgetting_, also called **[class-iNCD]** (for _class-incremental NCD_).  
ToDo definition and mathematical formulation.
